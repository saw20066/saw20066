👋 Hi, I’m Youness Kherbahce

Junior Software Developer focused on ASP.NET / C# backend development with a strong interest in building clean, secure, and scalable web applications.
I have a solid academic background in software development and hands-on experience through real projects where I designed, built, and managed full web applications from scratch.

Currently based in Lithuania, open to internship, junior, and remote opportunities.

🧑‍💻 About Me

I am a C# / ASP.NET developer with experience working on full-stack web applications using ASP.NET MVC, Entity Framework, and SQL Server.
I enjoy turning business requirements into functional systems, focusing on authentication, role management, admin dashboards, and clean data structures.

I mostly work independently and follow Agile practices, managing my own backlog, iterations, and improvements. I treat each project as a real product, not just an academic task.
